Opara: I remember the poster they used for the Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson version, and I thought it was so sensual. In the original poster from 1937, he’s looking up to her and also holding her in this sort of manner. If the story line’s exactly the same, the 2018 poster really doesn’t have a very good representation. And what’s up with the bloody palm trees?</p>
